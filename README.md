# Rust DataFrame

A dataframe implementation in Rust, powered by Apache Arrow.

## What is a dataframe?

A dataframe is a 2-dimensional tabular data structure that is often used for computations and other data transformations.
A dataframe often has columns of the same data type, similar to a SQL table.

## Functionality

This project is inspired by Pandas and other dataframe libraries, but specifically currently *borrows* functions from Apache Spark.

It mainly focuses on computation, and aims to include:

* Scalar functions
* Aggregate function
* Window functions
* Array functions

As a point of reference, we use [Apache Spark Python functions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#module-pyspark.sql.functions) for function parity, and aim to be compatible with Apache Spark functions.

## Eager vs Lazy Evaluation

The initial experiments of this project were to see if it's possible to create some form of dataframe. We're happy that this condition is met, however the initial version relied on eager evaluation, which would make it difficult to use in a REPL fashion, and make it slow.

We are mainly focusing on creating a process for lazy evaluation (the current `LazyFrame`), which involves reading an input's schema, then applying transformations on that schema until a materialising action is required.
While still figuring this out, there might not be much progress on the surface, as most of this exercise is happening offline.

The plan is to provide a reasonable API for lazily transforming data, and the ability to apply some optimisations on the computation graph (e.g. predicate pushdown, rearranging computations).

In the future, `LazyFrame` will probably be renamed to `DataFrame`, and the current `DataFrame` with eager evaluation removed/made private.

The ongoing experiments on lazy evaluation are in the `master` branch, and we would appreciate some help üôèüèæ.

## Non-Goals

Although we use Apache Spark as a reference, we do not intend on supporting distributed computation beyond a single machine.

Spark is a convenience to reduce bikeshedding, but we will probably provide a more Rust idiomatic API in future.

## Status

### Roadmap

- [ ] Lazy evaluation (H1 2020)
  - [ ] Aggregations
  - [ ] Joins
  - [ ] Sorting
- [ ] Adding compute `fn`s (H1 2020)
- [ ] Python bindings (H2 2020)

### IO

IO support isn't great yet, but this is not the best place to implement it. We are contributing to the effort in Apache Arrow's Rust implementation, and more contributors would be welcome there.

For now, we're trying to support CSV, JSON, and perhaps other simpler file formats.
**Note on Feather:** The Feather file format support can be considered as deprecated in favour of Arrow IPC. Though we have implemented Feather, it's meant to be a stop-gap measure until Arrow supports IPC (in Rust, anticipated at `1.0.0`).
